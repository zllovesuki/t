# certificate for the gateway and client connection will be issued by Let's Encrypt.

# once you bootstrap the leader node, the follower nodes will receive the certificates
# via state synchronization

acme:
  # this is used for automatic certificate issurance. Any RFC8555 complaint CA

  # this directory will store the account key on each of the peer. A leader election

  # distribute the certificates to other peers.
  # however, since any of the peers can become leader, the key will be shared to other peers
  # via encrypted peer channel.
